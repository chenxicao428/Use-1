      In Walter&Co.'s database optimization mission, we will focus on integrating the unique advantages of Salesforce and Microsoft Access to comprehensively enhance Saul's information management system. Our carefully designed prototype demonstrates excellent domain and relationship building capabilities in Salesforce, effectively establishing closer connections between tables and strengthening interdependencies between data. Meanwhile, we have introduced charts and visual effects into the Salesforce database to provide users with a smoother and more intuitive observation experience.

      <p>
      Although Salesforce excels in domain building and data relationships, we also recognize that its report generation is limited in specific aspects. Therefore, we will focus on customized report generation in future innovation to ensure that Saul Harm Law Firm can obtain more specific and accurate reports.

      <p>
      We are full of confidence in the future and will continue to innovate and improve our database system. We are committed to integrating best practices to ensure that Saul Harm Law Firm's team receives sufficient training and can fully utilize the new system. At the same time, we will ensure that the database system remains up-to-date, regularly updated and optimized to adapt to the constantly changing business requirements.
     
      <p>
      User feedback is crucial to us, and we will actively collect and analyze it in order to better understand the limitations and needs of the system and provide targeted improvements. Our goal is to provide a highly secure and compliant database system to ensure data security when handling sensitive customer information.
      
      <p>
      Through these professional measures, Walter&Co. will continue to assist Saul Harm Law Firm in improving efficiency, organization, and data management level.

        The "This Month's Case" report is organized by screening the trial dates of cases and only presents cases that are heard in the current month. To achieve this goal, two key filters were applied: the first filter excluded court records prior to the current data deadline, while the second filter selected cases that occurred after the current month. In this way, the report only presents cases related to the lawyer using the report. In addition, the report provides an estimated total settlement amount for these cases to reveal the potential settlement amount for unresolved cases.
